Overview
=========

SDL++ is currently a result of me experimenting with SDL. It aims to wrap most of the SDL API in an easy to
use C++11 interface. Note that this wrapper is a very thin wrapper. There should be very little differences in terms of
performance between using the wrapper and the API calls directly. Documentation is an on-going thing, as is the actual
interface.

SDL++ is currently header only. So there's no build step. The only thing needed to build at the moment is just SDL2. Versions
lower than SDL2 are not explicitly supported.

Users of the library are encouraged to read the user guide for questions they might have.
